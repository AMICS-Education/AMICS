        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Multiples of 3 or 5</strong></p>
        <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3
        or 5, we get 3,5,6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the
        sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We can calculate the sum directly. The
        multiples of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> below a number <span
        class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is given by <span
        class="math display">\[S(k,n) = k \sum_{i = 1}^{\left\lfloor \frac{n -
        1}{k} \right\rfloor} i = k \dfrac{\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k}
        \right\rfloor (\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1}{k} \right\rfloor +
        1)}{2}\]</span></p>
        <p>Then we just need to calculate <span class="math inline">\(S(3,1000)
        + S(5,1000) - S(15,1000)\)</span> (subtracting 15 because PIE)</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 233168</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Even Fibonacci numbers</strong></p>
        <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
        previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
        be: <span class="math display">\[1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89\]</span> By
        considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
        exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We implement 2 variables and a result
        variable. The key is to calculate the Fibonacci sequence by only taking
        into account the two current terms. Then, use an if statement to only
        add even terms to the sum.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 4613732</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Largest Prime Factor</strong></p>
        <p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 17, 13 and 29. What is the largest
        prime factor of the number 600851475143?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We implement a sieve of sorts to gradually
        filter out every prime factor. Firstly, we filter out powers of 2 from
        the number. Then, incrementing by 2 at a time until the square root of
        that number, we filter out prime factors. Finally we should be left with
        the largest prime factor.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 6857</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Largest Palindrome Product</strong></p>
        <p>A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
        made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 <span
        class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 99. Find the largest palindrome
        made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We can brute force this, but at least
        let’s do so smartly. Start from the top down: 999 <span
        class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 999, then 999 <span
        class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 998, and so on. The first
        palindrome we see will be the largest.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 906609</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Smallest Multiple</strong></p>
        <p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the
        numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest
        positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to
        20?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> It is easy to see that <span
        class="math inline">\(2520 = \lcm(1, 2, \ldots, 10)\)</span>. Then we
        just need to find a way to efficiently compute <span
        class="math inline">\(\lcm(1,2, \ldots, 20)\)</span>. We use the
        formula: <span class="math display">\[\lcm(1,2,\ldots,m) = \prod_{p \leq
        m} p^{\lfloor \log_p m \rfloor}\]</span> Use sieve of Eratosthenes to
        generate all primes up to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and
        implement a loop for the logarithmic product.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 232792560</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Sum Square Difference</strong></p>
        <p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, <span
        class="math display">\[1^2 + 2^2 +  \ldots + 10^2 = 385\]</span></p>
        <p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, <span
        class="math display">\[(1+2+\ldots+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025\]</span></p>
        <p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
        natural numbers and the square of the sum is <span
        class="math inline">\(3025 - 385 = 2640\)</span>. Find the difference
        between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers
        and the square of the sum.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This can be done very easily through the
        following two formulae: <span class="math display">\[1^2 + 2^2 +  \ldots
        + n^2 = \dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\]</span> <span
        class="math display">\[(1+2+\ldots+n)^2 = \left[ \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}
        \right]^2\]</span></p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 25164150</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>10 001st prime</strong></p>
        <p>By listing the first six prime numbers: 2,3,5,7, and 13, we can see
        that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We use the bound in the Prime Number
        Theorem to establish the ceiling for the sieve of Eratosthenes: <span
        class="math display">\[p_n &lt; n \ln n + n \ln \ln n\]</span> Then
        getting the 10 001st entry of the seive yields the result.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 104743</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Largest Product in a Series</strong></p>
        <p>Given a 1000-digit number. What is the largest 13 consecutive numbers
        that yield the biggest products?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use 2 nested loops to search through every
        13 consecutive digits and update the largest value. This brute force
        method is efficient enough.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 23514624000</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Special Pythagorean Triplet</strong></p>
        <p>A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, <span
        class="math inline">\(a &lt; b&lt;c\)</span>, for which: <span
        class="math display">\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]</span> For example: <span
        class="math inline">\(3^2 + 4^2 = 9+16 = 25 = 5^2\)</span></p>
        <p>There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which <span
        class="math inline">\(a + b + c  =1000\)</span>. Find the product <span
        class="math inline">\(abc\)</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We use the Pythagorean triplet generator.
        Let <span class="math inline">\(a = m^2 - n^2\)</span>, <span
        class="math inline">\(b = 2mn\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c =
        m^2 + n^2\)</span>. We need <span class="math inline">\(a + b + c =
        1000\)</span> so that’s equivalent to <span
        class="math display">\[m(m+n) = 500\]</span></p>
        <p>Then the remaining work is to solve that Diophantine equation by
        finding <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span
        class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that returns <span
        class="math inline">\(a,b,c &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 31875000</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Summation of Primes</strong></p>
        <p>The sum of the primes below 10 is <span
        class="math inline">\(2+3+5+7=17\)</span>. Find the sum of all the
        primes below two million.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use sieve of Eratosthenes at two million,
        then add each prime to the result.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 142913828922</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Largest Product in a Grid</strong></p>
        <p>What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same
        direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in a <span
        class="math inline">\(20 \times 20\)</span> grid?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Parse the input into a 2D list where you
        can access numbers as <code>grid[i][j]</code>. Remember that
        <code>i</code> gets the row and <code>j</code> gets the column. From
        here, write four functions to iterate through every vertical,
        horizontal, and two diagonals.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 70600674</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Highly Divisible Triangular Number</strong></p>
        <p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
        numbers. So the <span class="math inline">\(7^\text{th}\)</span>
        triangle number would be <span
        class="math inline">\(1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28\)</span>. We can see that 28 is
        the first triangular number to have over 5 divisors. What is the value
        of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong>. Firstly, we know that the <span
        class="math inline">\(n^\text{th}\)</span> triangular number is given by
        <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}\)</span>. We then use the
        fundamental theorem of arithmetic to factor triangular numbers into a
        product of powers of primes: <span class="math display">\[n =
        p_{1}^{\alpha_1}p_{2}^{\alpha_2}\ldots p_{k}^{\alpha_k}\]</span></p>
        <p>Then, the number of divisors is given by: <span
        class="math display">\[d = \prod_{i=1}^k (\alpha_i + 1)\]</span> We just
        have to write two separate <code>if</code> statements for even and odd
        <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 76576500</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Large Sum</strong></p>
        <p>Work out the first ten digits of the sum of a one-hundred 50-digit
        numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We parse the input to get a list with
        length 100. Then add all of them together and convert to a string. Print
        the first 10 characters of the string out.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 5537376230</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Longest Collatz Sequence</strong> The following iterative
        sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:</p>
        <p><span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \dfrac{n}{2}\)</span>
        (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even)</p>
        <p><span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow 3n+1\)</span> (<span
        class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd)</p>
        <p>Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
        sequence: <span class="math display">\[13 \rightarrow 40 \rightarrow 20
        \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4
        \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1\]</span></p>
        <p>It can be seen that this sequence contains 10 terms. Although it is
        not proven yet, it is assumed that all starting numbers finish at 1.
        Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest
        chain?</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to
        go above one million.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We use memoization. We implement the
        Collatz sequence as 2 conditionals while <span class="math inline">\(n
        \neq 1\)</span> run a counter every time <span
        class="math inline">\(n\)</span> changes. Then we cache the results into
        a list. Every time we hit a number that’s already been calculated, just
        add the number of steps from that number.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 837799</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Lattice Paths</strong></p>
        <p>Starting in the top left corner of a <span class="math inline">\(2
        \times 2\)</span> grid, and only being able to move to the right and
        down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many
        such routes are there through a <span class="math inline">\(20 \times
        20\)</span> grid?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We can find the number of routes through
        an <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> grid. We know that
        there will definitely be <span class="math inline">\(m+n\)</span> steps.
        Now consider a binary string of length <span
        class="math inline">\(m+n\)</span>. For each time we go down, a bit
        flips to 1, and each time we go to the right, it flips to 0. Then the
        problem turns into "How many ways are there to position <span
        class="math inline">\(m\)</span> 1’s among <span
        class="math inline">\(n\)</span> 0’s?" By Stars and Bars, there are
        exactly <span class="math inline">\(\binom{m+n}{m}\)</span> ways.</p>
        <p>Now we need a way to compute <span
        class="math inline">\(\binom{40}{20}\)</span> using dynamic programming.
        We use the following identity: <span
        class="math display">\[\binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n}{k}
        \dfrac{n-k}{k+1}\]</span> Initialise <span
        class="math inline">\(\binom{40}{0} = 1\)</span> as a list
        <code>c = [1]</code>, then print out the <span
        class="math inline">\(20^\text{th}\)</span> value and we’re
        done.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Power Digit Sum</strong></p>
        <p><span class="math inline">\(2^{15} = 32768\)</span> and the sum of
        its digits is <span class="math inline">\(3+2+7+6+8 = 26\)</span>. What
        is the sum of the digits of the number <span
        class="math inline">\(2^{1000}\)</span>?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Calculate <span
        class="math inline">\(2^{1000}\)</span>, convert it into a string,
        convert each char of the string into an integer, and add them all
        up.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: 1366</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Number Letter Counts</strong></p>
        <p>If the numbers <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
        class="math inline">\(5\)</span> are written out in words: one, two,
        three, four, five, then there are <span class="math inline">\(3 + 3 + 5
        + 4 + 4 = 19\)</span> letters used in total. If all the numbers from
        <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
        class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> (one thousand) inclusive were
        written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example,
        <span class="math inline">\(342\)</span> (three hundred and forty-two)
        contains <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> letters and <span
        class="math inline">\(115\)</span> (one hundred and fifteen) contains
        <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> letters. The use of "and" when
        writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the python library
        <code>num2words</code> then parse the input: delete all white space and
        hyphens.</p>
