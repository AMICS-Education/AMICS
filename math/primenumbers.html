    <h2 id="section1">1. Prime Numbers</h2>
    
    <h3 id="section1-1">1.1 Definition and basic theorems</h3>
    
    <p>Prime numbers have been closely studied by mathematicians ever since they were recognised. They are central to number theory due to their intriguing properties and their elusive unpredictability. First, let's ask ourselves: What are primes?</p>
    
    <div class="theorem-box">
        <div class="definition">Definition 1:</div>
        An integer $p > 1$ is called a <strong>prime</strong> if its only divisors are 1 and $p$ itself.
    </div>
    
    <p>By definition, the first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. They have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Numbers that aren't prime are called <strong>composite numbers</strong>, and are based on primes. Notice how there are infinitely many integers, and how composite numbers are made up of primes. Then we have the two most fundamental properties of primes:</p>
    
    <div class="theorem-box">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unique factorization</strong> (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic):
                <br>Any integer $n > 1$ has a unique representation as a product of primes.</li>
            <li><strong>Infinitude</strong> (Euclid's theorem):
                <br>There are infinitely many primes.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <p>For example, the number 75 can be written as $3 \times 5 \times 5$, or $3 \times 5^2$, where 3 and 5 are primes. The numbers 3 and 5 here are called the <strong>prime factors</strong> of 75. Notice that you can do this for all numbers, generating any combination of products of prime powers. We then have the <strong>canonical factorization</strong> of any integer $n$:</p>
    
    <div class="math-display">
        $$n = p_{1}^{\alpha_1} \dotsm p_{k}^{\alpha_k}$$
    </div>

    <h2 id="section2">2. Primality check with trial division</h2>
    
    <h3 id="section2-1">2.1 Trial division</h3>
    
    <p>The property of being prime is called <strong>primality</strong>. Suppose you are given a random integer $n$. How would you determine if it is prime? Well first, except for 2, every even number is automatically composite, as it is divisible by 2. Any number that ends with 5 other than 5 itself also automatically fails the primality test for the same reason. From this, we have established that primes can only end with digits 1, 3, 7, and 9. Even then, suppose you are given a random integer ending with one of those four digits, how would you determine if it is prime?</p>
    
    <p>You might be tempted to check every integer up to $n$ and see if it divides $n$, but that is a bit superfluous. You only need to check integers up to $\sqrt{n}$, as the product of 2 factors larger than that will produce a number bigger than $n$. This is a simple check, but it is impractical for large numbers. Luckily, we developed much better tests over time, some of them being important theorems in number theory.</p>

    <h2 id="section3">3. Modular arithmetic and important theorems</h2>
    
    <h3 id="section3-1">3.1 Modular arithmetic</h3>
    
    <p>Modular arithmetic is important in expressing number theory ideas. For example, saying 18 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 2 is the same as saying 18 is congruent to 2 modulo 4, or in modular notation, $18 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$. It's like an analogue watch: you look at 2pm and you know that it's the 14th hour in the day, because $14 \equiv 2 \pmod{12}$. We consider modulo 12 for telling time, and other modulo for different purposes. More formally, we have:</p>
    
    <div class="theorem-box">
        <div class="definition">Definition 2:</div>
        Given an integer $m$ and integers $a$, $b$. We say $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ if $m | a-b$, in which case we write $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$. Conversely, we say $a$ is not congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ and write $a \not\equiv b \pmod{m}$.
    </div>
    
    <p>From the definition, we see that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ if and only if there exists some integer $k$ such that $a = b+km$. We also have some elementary properties:</p>
    
    <div class="theorem-box">
        <ol>
            <li>(Reflexivity) $a \equiv a \pmod{m}$.</li>
            <li>(Commutativity) If $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ then $b \equiv a \pmod{m}$.</li>
            <li>(Transitivity) If $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ and $b \equiv c \pmod{m}$ then $a \equiv c \pmod{m}$.</li>
        </ol>
        
        Also, for any integer $m$ and integers $a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_m; b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ such that $a_i \equiv b_i$ for all $i = 1,2, \ldots, m$, then the following holds:
        <ol>
            <li>$\sum_{i=1}^{m}{a_i} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{m}{b_i} \pmod{m}$</li>
            <li>$\prod_{i=1}^{m}{a_i} \equiv \prod_{i=1}^{m}{b_i} \pmod{m}$</li>
        </ol>
        
        Also, if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ then $a^n \equiv b^n \pmod{n}$.
        
        <p>We also have an important definition: Given a positive integer $m$ and an integer $a$. An integer $b$ is called the <strong>modular inverse multiplicative</strong> of $a$ modulo $n$ if $ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="section3-2">3.2 Fermat's primality test</h3>
    
    <p>First, we must know Fermat's little theorem, an important tool in finding primes.</p>
    
    <div class="theorem-box">
        <strong>Fermat's little theorem:</strong> If $p$ is a prime, then for any integer $a$, we have $a^p - a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$
    </div>
    
    <p>However, the inverse is not true. There are composite numbers that satisfies $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. These numbers are called <strong>Carmichael numbers</strong>, and are the sole reason why this test is not deterministic. Before going into further details about the accuracy of this test, we will first show you how it works:</p>
    
    <div class="algorithm-box">
        <p><strong>Input:</strong> $n > 3$, a value to test for primality; $k$, a parameter that determines the number of times to test for primality</p>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong> <strong>composite</strong> if $n$ is composite, otherwise <strong>probably prime</strong>.</p>
        <p>Repeat $k$ times:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick $a$ randomly in $[2, n-2]$</li>
            <li>If $a^{n-1} \not\equiv 1$, return <strong>composite</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Otherwise, return <strong>probably prime</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>We know that it holds trivially for $a \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and $a \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$, so naturally, we would pick all $1 < a < p-1$ for the least computation needed. If we have $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, we cannot conclude that $n$ is a prime number. Any $a$ satisfying the relation above but with $n$ being composite is called a <strong>Fermat liar</strong>, and $n$ is called a <strong>Fermat pseudoprime to base $a$</strong>. If we do pick an integer $a$ such that $a^{n-1} \not\equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, then that is the <strong>Fermat's witness</strong> for the compositeness of $n$.</p>
    
    <div class="example">
        <p>For example, let's check the number 221. Picking $a = 38$ from $1 < a < 220$, we see that:</p>
        <div class="math-display">
            $$a^{n-1} = 38^{220} \equiv 1 \pmod{221}$$
        </div>
        <p>Then either 221 is prime, or 38 is a Fermat liar. Taking another number $a = 24$, we have:</p>
        <div class="math-display">
            $$a^{n-1} = 24^{220} \equiv 81 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{221}$$
        </div>
        <p>Then 221 is not a prime, and 24 is the Fermat witness of the compositeness of 221.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Given the flaws, the algorithm for Fermat's primality test can still tell us if a number is probably a prime or not.</p>
    
    <p>It is better than Wilson's theorem to test primality, but we can do better than this probabilistic method. Throughout the years, we have developed very reliable prime checking methods, namely the Miller-Rabin primality test, the AKS primality test, Lucas-Lehmer test (for Mersenne primes, which are primes of the form $2^n - 1$), and elliptic curve primality proving. In the list above, all but the Miller-Rabin test is deterministic, but they are all too slow for practical usage. Therefore, the Miller-Rabin test, though probabilistic, remains the most efficient prime checking method, as it strikes a balance between speed and accuracy, making it the go-to choice for generating large primes where absolute certainty is not necessary (since multiple rounds of the test drastically reduce the probability of error).</p>
