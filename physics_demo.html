        <h3 id="motion-in-one-dimension">Motion in One Dimension</h3>
        <p>The study of motion without external agents is called kinematics.
        There are three main types of motion: translational, rotational, and
        vibrational. For simplicity’s sake, we are going to treat objects as
        particles: they have mass, but are infinitesimally small.</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="position-velocity-and-speed">Position,
        Velocity, and Speed</h4>
        <p>A particle’s position is its location relative to a reference point.
        Its displacement is defined as the change in position in some time
        interval. As the particle moves from <span
        class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> to <span
        class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, its displacement is: <span
        class="math display">\[\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\]</span></p>
        <p>The Greek character <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>
        (Delta) generally means <em>difference</em>. We also have the concept of
        velocity, which is the change in position with respect to time.
        Mathematically, that is: <span class="math display">\[v_{x,\text{avg}} =
        \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\]</span></p>
        <p>This is the average velocity over a period of time. We can see that
        its sign depends on the displacement, because <span
        class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>. But there’s also speed, which
        depends on distance, so it’s always positive: <span
        class="math display">\[v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{d}{\Delta t}\]</span></p>
        <div class="important">
        <ul>
        <li><p>Displacement is a vector quantity, but distance is a scalar
        quantity.</p></li>
        <li><p>Velocity is a vector quantity, but speed is a scalar
        quantity.</p></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h4 class="unnumbered"
        id="instantaneous-velocity-and-speed">Instantaneous Velocity and
        Speed</h4>
        <p>This is where calculus jumps in. We take the limit as the intervals
        of time go to zero, and we acquire: <span class="math display">\[v_x =
        \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} =
        \dfrac{\dd x}{\dd t}\]</span></p>
        <div class="concept">
        <p><em>The derivative of displacement with respect to time is
        velocity.</em></p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="unnumbered"
        id="analysis-models-the-particle-under-constant-velocity">Analysis
        Models: The Particle Under Constant Velocity</h4>
        <p>We’ll try to describe the particle. We know that the velocity is
        constant, so the only thing to find out here is its displacement.
        Luckily, this is simple. Rearranging (2) gives: <span
        class="math display">\[x_2 = x_1 + v_x t\]</span> These analysis models
        get tougher over time.</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="acceleration">Acceleration</h4>
        <p>Analogously, we define acceleration as the change in velocity over
        time. Then we have the equation of average acceleration: <span
        class="math display">\[a_{x, \text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta
        t}\]</span> and similarly, the instantaneous acceleration: <span
        class="math display">\[a_x = \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \dfrac{\Delta
        v_x}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{\dd v}{\dd t}\]</span></p>
        <div class="concept">
        <p><em>The derivative of velocity with respect to time is
        acceleration.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>In 1D kinematics, if the velocity and acceleration are pointing in
        the same direction, then the object is speeding up and vice versa.</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="the-particle-under-constant-acceleration">The
        Particle Under Constant Acceleration</h4>
        <p>Let’s tackle the most simple case. Because acceleration is the
        derivative of velocity, so if it’s a constant, then the velocity changes
        linearly. We can write: <span class="math display">\[v_{x_2} = v_{x_1} +
        a_x t\]</span> And if velocity is a linear function, then that means
        displacement will be a quadratic. Integrating both sides give: <span
        class="math display">\[x_2 = x_1 + v_{x_1} t + \dfrac{1}{2}a_x
        t^2\]</span> We can even extract velocity as a function of position. We
        know: <span class="math display">\[v_{x_2} = v_{x_1} + a_x t\]</span>
        <span class="math display">\[x_2 = x_1 + \left( \dfrac{v_{x_1} +
        v_{x_2}}{2}\right) t\]</span> Substitute <span
        class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in gives: <span
        class="math display">\[x_2 - x_1 =  \dfrac{(v_{x_1} + v_{x_2})(v_{x_2} -
        v_{x_1})}{2a_x}\]</span> And we have the final form: <span
        class="math display">\[v_{x_2}^2 - v_{x_1}^2 = 2a_x d\]</span></p>
        <div class="insight">
        <p>We have 4 important equations:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(v_{x_2} = v_{x_1} + a_x
        t\)</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(x_2 = x_1 + \left( \dfrac{v_{x_1} +
        v_{x_2}}{2}\right) t\)</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(x_2 = x_1 + v_{x_1} t +
        \dfrac{1}{2}a_x t^2\)</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(v_{x_2}^2 - v_{x_1}^2 = 2a_x
        d\)</span></p></li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="free-fall">Free Fall</h4>
        <p>In free fall, objects undergo constant acceleration <span
        class="math inline">\(g \approx 9.8 \mathrm{m/s^2}\)</span>, and
        starting velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_{x_1} = 0\)</span>. Then
        we have a series of equations:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(v = gt\)</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(t =
        \sqrt{\dfrac{2h}{g}}\)</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(v_{\text{final}} =
        \sqrt{2gh}\)</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="vectors">Vectors</h3>
        <p>Vectors are born because we need to study quantities that have both
        magnitude and direction. To describe them mathematically, we employ the
        use of coordinate systems.</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="coordinate-systems">Coordinate Systems</h4>
        <p>In 2D, there are 2 main types of coordinate systems: The Cartesian
        system <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> and the polar system
        <span class="math inline">\((r,\theta)\)</span>. It’s worth knowing that
        <span class="math inline">\(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)</span> and <span
        class="math inline">\(\theta = \arctan{\dfrac{y}{x}}\)</span>.</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="vector-and-scalar-quantities">Vector and
        Scalar Quantities</h4>
        <p>It’s all about if the quantities are directional or not.</p>
        <div class="concept">
        <ul>
        <li><p>A <strong>scalar quantity</strong> is completely specified by a
        single value with an appropriate unit and has no direction.</p></li>
        <li><p>A <strong>vector quantity</strong> is completely specified by a
        number and appropriate units plus a direction.</p></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>We denote a vector as boldface characters, like <span
        class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, or <span
        class="math inline">\(\vec{a}\)</span>. Their magnitude is given by
        <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{A}|\)</span> or <span
        class="math inline">\(|\vec{a}|\)</span></p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered" id="some-properties-of-vectors">Some Properties
        of Vectors</h4>
        <p>They obey commutativity and associativity under addition. The
        negative of a vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is
        <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{-A}\)</span>, and their sum is 0.
        The negative vector has the same magnitude, but it points in the
        opposite direction.</p>
        <p>Subtracting <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A - B}\)</span> is
        the same as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A + (-B)}\)</span>. When
        multiplying a vector by a scalar, only the magnitude changes. The
        direction stays the same.</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered"
        id="components-of-a-vector-and-unit-vectors">Components of a Vector and
        Unit Vectors</h4>
        <p>We can split a vector along the chosen axes. Writing <span
        class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}_x + \mathbf{A}_y\)</span>
        and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}_x +
        \mathbf{B}_y\)</span>, we can quickly calculate the resultant vector:
        <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R} = (\mathbf{A+B})_x +
        (\mathbf{A+B})_y\)</span>. The resultant magnitude and direction are
        obtained similarly to how we convert from Cartesian to polar.</p>
        <p>More commonly, we see people write unit vectors: <span
        class="math display">\[\mathbf{A} = x\mathbf{\vec{i}} +
        y\mathbf{\vec{j}} + z\mathbf{\vec{k}}\]</span></p>
        <p>They’re essentially splitting the vectors into its components and
        making sure that the magnitude is 1.</p>
        <h3 id="motion-in-two-dimensions">Motion in Two Dimensions</h3>
        <p>Now that we have the tools for 2D kinematics, we can study motion in
        two dimensions by splitting the vectors of motion into their components
        along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
        class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axes, therefore reducing the complexity
        back to 1D (in some sense).</p>
        <h4 class="unnumbered"
        id="the-position-velocity-and-acceleration-vectors">The Position,
        Velocity and Acceleration Vectors</h4>
        <p>Let’s describe the position of a particle as a vector <span
        class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\vec{r}}\)</span>, drawn from the origin
        to the particles position in the coordinate plane. Then we define the
        velocity vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\vec{v}}\)</span>
        and as per the formulae established earlier, we have: <span
        class="math display">\[\mathbf{\vec{v}} =
        \dfrac{\Delta\mathbf{\vec{r}}}{\Delta t}\]</span> Because time is a
        scalar quantity, we deduce that velocity is a vector quantity directed
        along <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \mathbf{\vec{r}}\)</span>.</p>
        <div class="confusion">
        <p>Remember, the velocity is independent of the path taken, as it only
        takes into account the displacement between the final and initial
        position. The speed, however, is calculated by the total length of the
        path divided over time.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Instantaneous velocity and acceleration is defined analogously, only
        this time we are dealing with vector-valued functions.</p>
